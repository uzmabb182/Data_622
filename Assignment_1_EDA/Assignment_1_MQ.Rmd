# Bank Marketing Dataset Variables  

The dataset’s main purpose is to predict whether a bank client will subscribe to a term deposit (`y = yes/no`) after a marketing campaign. Each variable provides information that may help explain or predict that outcome.  

---

## Client Information (Who the Customer Is)  

- **age (numeric)**  
  - *Recording:* Client’s age in years.  
  - *Purpose:* Age often influences financial decisions (e.g., younger clients may avoid long-term deposits, older clients may be more interested in safe investments).  

- **job (categorical)**  
  - *Recording:* Type of job (e.g., admin, blue-collar, technician).  
  - *Purpose:* Occupation reflects income stability and financial behavior.  

- **marital (categorical)**  
  - *Recording:* Marital status (single, married, divorced/widowed).  
  - *Purpose:* Family responsibilities affect savings and investment behavior.  

- **education (categorical)**  
  - *Recording:* Highest education level completed.  
  - *Purpose:* Education level may indicate financial literacy and likelihood to invest.  

- **default (categorical)**  
  - *Recording:* Whether client has credit in default ("yes", "no", "unknown").  
  - *Purpose:* Default history reflects financial risk and trustworthiness.  

- **housing (categorical)**  
  - *Recording:* Whether client has a housing loan.  
  - *Purpose:* Mortgage holders may have less disposable income for deposits.  

- **loan (categorical)**  
  - *Recording:* Whether client has a personal loan.  
  - *Purpose:* Personal loans indicate financial obligations that may reduce likelihood of subscribing.  

---

## Last Contact Information (How They Were Reached)  

- **contact (categorical)**  
  - *Recording:* Communication type ("cellular" or "telephone").  
  - *Purpose:* Some contact methods are more effective than others.  

- **month (categorical)**  
  - *Recording:* Month of the last contact.  
  - *Purpose:* Seasonal effects — campaign success may vary across the year.  

- **day_of_week (categorical)**  
  - *Recording:* Day of the week client was contacted.  
  - *Purpose:* Some days may be better for reaching clients (e.g., midweek vs. Monday).  

- **duration (numeric)**  
  - *Recording:* Call duration in seconds.  
  - *Purpose:* Longer conversations often mean higher engagement.  
  - *Note:* Duration is only known after the call, so it cannot be used in real prediction models.  

---

## Campaign History (Past Interactions)  

- **campaign (numeric)**  
  - *Recording:* Number of contacts during this campaign (including the last one).  
  - *Purpose:* Too many contacts may annoy clients, reducing success.  

- **pdays (numeric)**  
  - *Recording:* Days since last contact from a previous campaign (999 = never contacted).  
  - *Purpose:* Recency matters; recently contacted clients may behave differently.  

- **previous (numeric)**  
  - *Recording:* Number of contacts before this campaign.  
  - *Purpose:* Reflects persistence of bank marketing; may affect likelihood of success.  

- **poutcome (categorical)**  
  - *Recording:* Outcome of the previous campaign ("success", "failure", "nonexistent").  
  - *Purpose:* Past behavior often predicts future responses.  

---

## Economic Context (Overall Environment)  

- **emp.var.rate (numeric)**  
  - *Recording:* Employment variation rate (quarterly).  
  - *Purpose:* Measures labor market changes — people may invest more when jobs are stable.  

- **cons.price.idx (numeric)**  
  - *Recording:* Consumer Price Index (monthly).  
  - *Purpose:* Inflation affects purchasing power and saving behavior.  

- **cons.conf.idx (numeric)**  
  - *Recording:* Consumer Confidence Index (monthly).  
  - *Purpose:* High confidence = more willingness to invest, low confidence = caution.  

- **euribor3m (numeric)**  
  - *Recording:* Euribor 3-month interest rate.  
  - *Purpose:* Competes with deposit rates — higher Euribor may reduce deposit attractiveness.  

- **nr.employed (numeric)**  
  - *Recording:* Number of employees (quarterly labor market indicator).  
  - *Purpose:* Reflects macroeconomic health; higher employment often correlates with more savings.  

---

## Target Variable  

- **y (binary: "yes" / "no")**  
  - *Recording:* Whether the client subscribed to a term deposit.  
  - *Purpose:* This is the outcome to predict.

```

## Are There Missing Values?  

The dataset does not contain raw `NA` values, but instead uses **special codes or labels** to represent “missing” or “not applicable.” These are **structural missing values** and must be considered carefully during analysis.  

---

### Where They Occur  

- **Categorical variables with `"unknown"`**  
  - *default:* `"unknown"` is very common (many clients do not disclose credit default history).  
  - *education:* includes an `"unknown"` category (~5% of records).  
  - *job:* contains a small number of `"unknown"` entries.  

- **Special numeric code – `pdays = 999`**  
  - Indicates the client was **not previously contacted**.  
  - Dominates the column (~96% of rows).  
  - Not truly “missing,” but a **placeholder code** that should be treated as its own category.  

---

### Significance of Missingness  

- **default = "unknown":** Very significant because it covers a large fraction of the data. Dropping it would result in too much information loss, so it should be treated as its own level (“missing info”).  
- **education = "unknown":** Smaller but still relevant; may need grouping with other low-frequency categories.  
- **job = "unknown":** Rare and not very impactful, but still worth encoding properly.  
- **pdays = 999:** Extremely significant since it applies to almost all clients. If not handled correctly, it can distort model training.  

---

### Final Answer  

Yes, there are missing values, but they appear as **coded placeholders** rather than raw `NA`:  

- `"unknown"` in categorical variables (*default, education, job*).  
- `pdays = 999` meaning “not previously contacted.”  

These placeholders are highly significant because they cover a large portion of the dataset (especially *pdays* and *default*). Instead of dropping them, they should be **treated as meaningful categories or carefully recoded** for modeling.  


```{r}
# Unique values in categorical variables (factor/character columns)
lapply(bank_additional_df[sapply(bank_additional_df, is.character)], unique)

```


```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)

# Select only character (categorical) columns
categorical_df <- bank_additional_df %>% select(where(is.character))

# Using describe () for summary statsw
describe(categorical_df)


```

What is the overall distribution of each variable?

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(forcats)
library(viridis)

# Separate categorical and numeric columns
categorical_df <- bank_additional_df %>% select(where(is.character))

      plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = "bold")
    ) +

    ggtitle(paste("Distribution of", col))
  
  print(p)
}

# Plot numeric variables

  p <- numeric_df %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = .data[[col]])) +
    geom_histogram(bins = 30, fill = viridis(1, begin = 0.2, end = 0.9), alpha = 0.8) +
    theme_minimal() +
    theme(
      axis.text.x = element_text(size = 9),
      axis.title.x = element_text(size = 11),
      axis.title.y = element_text(size = 11),
      plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = "bold")
    ) +
    ylab("Frequency") +
    xlab(col) +
    ggtitle(paste("Distribution of", col))
  
  print(p)
}


```

## How Are Categorical Variables Distributed?  

### Job  
- Bars show how many clients belong to each job type.  
- **Most common:** *admin.*, *blue-collar*, and *technician*.  
- **Rare categories:** *illiterate* and *unknown* (very small bars).  

---

### Marital Status  
- Categories: *married*, *single*, *divorced*.  
- **Married** is the dominant group.  

---

### Education  
- Compares counts of *basic*, *high.school*, and *university.degree*.  
- Reveals which education level is most common in the dataset.  

---

### Default / Housing / Loan  
- Variables have levels: *yes / no / unknown*.  
- **Default:** Vast majority are *no* or *unknown*; very few *yes*.  
- **Housing loan:** Many *yes*, but also a large portion *no*.  
- **Personal loan:** Mostly *no*; *yes* is rare.  
- In all cases, *no* overwhelmingly dominates.  

---

### Contact Method  
- *cellular* vs *telephone*.  
- In later campaigns, **cellular dominates**, so that bar is higher.  

---

### Month / Day of Week  
- Show seasonal patterns of campaign activity.  
- **Peak months:** May, August, July, November → tall bars.  
- Day of week distribution shows midweek contacts were more common.  

---

### Previous Outcome (poutcome)  
- Outcome of the previous marketing campaign.  
- Almost all are *nonexistent* → one very tall bar.  
- *Failure* and *success* are very short.  

---

### Target Variable (y)  
- *yes* vs *no* (subscription to term deposit).  
- Strong class imbalance: **~88% no vs. ~12% yes**.  

---

##  Interpretation Takeaways  

- **Imbalance:** Most categorical features are highly imbalanced (e.g., *default*, *poutcome*, *y*).  
- **Dominant categories:** Certain levels dominate distributions (e.g., *married* in marital, *cellular* in contact).  
- **Modeling insight:** These plots highlight the need for **rebalancing, proper encoding, or collapsing rare categories** before building predictive models.  


```{r}

# Correlation matrix for numeric columns
numeric_vars <- bank_additional_df[sapply(bank_additional_df, is.numeric)]
cor(numeric_vars, use = "complete.obs")

```
## What Are the Relationships Between Different Variables?  
Are the features (columns) of the dataset correlated?  

---

### Pairwise Correlations  

- **age & duration (-0.00087):** Essentially zero; the client’s age has no linear relationship with call duration.  
- **age & campaign (0.0046):** Nearly zero; older clients are not contacted more or less often.  
- **age & pdays (-0.034):** Very weak negative correlation; older clients are slightly more likely to have been contacted recently in previous campaigns, but the effect is negligible.  
- **age & previous (0.024):** Essentially no correlation; age does not relate to prior contacts.  

- **duration & campaign (-0.072):** Very weak negative correlation; longer calls are slightly associated with fewer contacts in this campaign.  
- **duration & pdays (-0.048):** Very weak negative correlation; call duration is not meaningfully related to days since last contact.  
- **duration & previous (0.021):** Almost zero; prior contacts do not affect call length.  

- **campaign & pdays (0.053):** Very weak positive correlation; clients contacted longer ago may have slightly more contacts in this campaign.  
- **campaign & previous (-0.079):** Very weak negative correlation; more prior contacts are slightly associated with fewer contacts in this campaign.  

- **pdays & previous (-0.588):** Moderate to strong negative correlation; as days since last contact (pdays) increases, the number of prior contacts decreases. This makes sense: if someone was contacted long ago, there were fewer previous contacts.  

---

### Key Takeaways  

- **Most variables show very weak correlations** (close to 0), meaning they are largely independent.  
- **The only strong relationship** is between *pdays* and *previous* (-0.588), which is meaningful for modeling.  
- **Variables such as age, duration, and campaign** are not strongly correlated with each other, so **multicollinearity is unlikely** among them.  

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

# bank <- bank_additional_df  # your data

bank <- bank_additional_df %>%
  mutate(
    y = factor(y, levels = c("no","yes")),
    y_num = as.numeric(y) - 1
  )

numeric_candidates <- c(
  "age","duration","campaign","pdays","previous",
  "emp.var.rate","cons.price.idx","cons.conf.idx","euribor3m","nr.employed","y_num"
)

bank_num <- bank %>%
  mutate(across(all_of(intersect(names(bank), numeric_candidates)),
                ~ suppressWarnings(as.numeric(.)))) %>%
  select(any_of(numeric_candidates)) %>%
  select(where(~ !all(is.na(.))))

cmat <- cor(bank_num, use = "complete.obs")

# Long format for ggplot
corr_long <- as.data.frame(as.table(cmat)) %>%
  setNames(c("Var1","Var2","value"))

ggplot(corr_long, aes(Var1, Var2, fill = value)) +
  geom_tile(color = "white") +
  scale_fill_gradient2(low = "#2166AC", mid = "white", high = "#B2182B",
                       midpoint = 0, limits = c(-1, 1), name = "corr") +
  geom_text(aes(label = sprintf("%.2f", value)), size = 3) +
  labs(title = "Correlation Heatmap (numeric features + y_num)", x = NULL, y = NULL) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 12) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

```
## Correlation Heatmap Interpretation  

The heatmap displays **Pearson correlation coefficients** between numeric features (ranging from –1 to +1).  

- **Red:** strong positive correlation  
- **Blue:** strong negative correlation  
- **White:** near zero (no linear relationship)  
- **Numbers inside each tile:** exact correlation values  

---

### Key Observations  

- **Target Variable (y_num)**  
  - Weak correlations overall (|r| < 0.4).  
  - Slight positive relationship with *duration* (0.41) and *nr.employed* (0.35).  
  - Weak negative relationships with *pdays* (–0.32) and *previous* (–0.23).  
  - *Interpretation:* Subscription outcome is only weakly associated with individual numeric features.  

- **Strong Positive Correlations**  
  - *euribor3m* and *nr.employed* (0.97).  
  - *euribor3m* and *emp.var.rate* (0.95).  
  - *emp.var.rate* and *nr.employed* (0.91).  
  - *cons.price.idx* and *euribor3m* (0.88).  
  - *Interpretation:* These economic indicators move together, showing redundancy. Dimensionality reduction or feature selection may be needed.  

- **Strong Negative Correlations**  
  - *pdays* and *previous* (–0.59).  
  - *emp.var.rate* and *cons.conf.idx* (–0.53).  
  - *euribor3m* and *cons.conf.idx* (–0.53).  
  - *Interpretation:* Clients contacted long ago had fewer prior contacts; consumer confidence moves opposite to employment variation and interest rates.  

- **Near-Zero Correlations**  
  - *Age* with nearly all variables (–0.01 to 0.13).  
  - *Campaign* with most others (–0.08 to 0.15).  
  - *Interpretation:* These features are largely independent.  

---

### Takeaways  

- **y_num** has only weak direct correlations → predictive strength will likely come from interactions or non-linear effects.  
- **Economic variables (euribor3m, nr.employed, emp.var.rate, cons.price.idx)** are highly correlated → risk of multicollinearity; may need PCA or dropping redundant features.  
- **pdays and previous** show a meaningful negative relationship (–0.59) → consistent with campaign structure.  
- **Most other features are independent**, reducing concerns of multicollinearity outside of the economic block.  

Overall, the heatmap highlights **clusters of correlated economic indicators** and a few notable structural relationships, but confirms that **most client-level features are weakly correlated**. This suggests feature engineering (e.g., creating flags or buckets) may be more useful than relying on raw numeric values.

# Quick Refresher: Boxplot Guide  

- **Center line:** median  
- **Box:** IQR (Q1–Q3)  
- **Whiskers:** last data points within Q1 − 1.5·IQR and Q3 + 1.5·IQR  
- **Dots:** outliers (beyond those fences)  

*Note:* This figure uses free scales per panel, so don’t compare absolute heights across panels.  

---

## Interpretation of Boxplots  

### Age  
- Most ages fall between **45–60 years**.  
- Median age: **~50**.  
- Outliers: a few very high ages (80–100+). Not errors, but much higher than majority.  

### Campaign  
- Represents number of contacts made to a client during a campaign.  
- Middle 50% of values: **1–3 contacts**.  
- Median: ~**1–2 contacts**.  
- Outliers: Many clients contacted **10–40+ times** → unusual.  

### Consumer Confidence Index (cons.conf.idx)  
- Values: –45 to –37, median ~ –41 to –42.  
- Indicates generally pessimistic sentiment.  
- Outlier: one less negative value (~ –35).  

### Consumer Price Index (cons.price.idx)  
- Values tightly clustered: **93.5–94.0**, median ~93.8.  
- Very stable — no outliers.  

### Duration (Seconds)  
- Represents last call duration.  
- Middle 50%: a few hundred seconds (minutes).  
- Median: **under 500–600 sec (~10 minutes)**.  
- Outliers: Many calls lasted **2000–5000 seconds (1+ hour)**.  

### Employment Variation Rate (emp.var.rate)  
- Range: –2% to +1%.  
- Median: ~0%.  
- Whiskers: –3.5% to +1.5%.  
- Compact distribution, no extreme outliers.  

### Euribor 3m  
- Median: ~3%.  
- Middle 50%: **2%–4%**.  
- Range: 1%–5%.  
- No outliers.  

### Number Employed (nr.employed)  
- Median: ~5160.  
- Middle 50%: **5100–5200**.  
- Stable, tight distribution.  

### Pdays  
- Special code = **999** (never contacted before).  
- Dominates distribution (~96% of clients).  
- Outliers: very small number of clients with values near 0.  
- Should be treated as categorical: *contacted before vs not contacted*.  

### Previous  
- Median: 0.  
- Most clients never contacted before.  
- Outliers: a few clients contacted **1–7 times**.  

---

## Relationship Between Variables  

Even if variables are not correlated, they can be combined into meaningful features.  

- **Age × Job:** Older clients in certain jobs may respond differently. → `age * job`.  
- **Loan status + Housing loan:** Clients with both loans may signal financial stress. → `any_loan`.  
- **Duration × Outcome (y):** Long calls often mean higher engagement.  
- **Economic indicators:** Combine `emp.var.rate`, `cons.price.idx`, `cons.conf.idx`, `euribor3m`, `nr.employed` into an index.  
- **Pdays + Previous:** Recently contacted & frequent contacts may behave differently.  

**Answer in short:**  
Yes, even if variables are not correlated, they can be combined into new, meaningful features. Example: height + weight → BMI. In this dataset: housing loan + personal loan → overall debt indicator. Domain knowledge guides feature engineering.  

---

## Do Any Patterns or Trends Emerge?  

- **Marketing months:** Contacts peak in May, Aug, Jul, Nov.  
- **Contact duration:** Longer calls → higher likelihood of subscription.  
- **Loans:** Clients without loans/defaults slightly more likely to subscribe.  
- **Age & job:** Middle-aged (30–50) and professionals dominate.  
- **Economic indicators:** Lower euribor3m and better emp.var.rate → higher subscriptions.  
- **Target imbalance:** Term deposit subscription is rare (~12%).  

**Summary:** Campaigns are seasonal, call length matters, and both demographics and macroeconomics influence outcomes.  

---

## Central Tendency and Spread  

- **Age:** Mean ~40, median 38, range 17–98.  
- **Duration:** Mean ~258 sec, median ~180 sec, skewed with long outliers.  
- **Campaign:** Median 2, mean ~2.6, max 56.  
- **Pdays:** Median 999, mean ~962.  
- **Previous:** Median 0, mean 0.17, max 7.  
- **emp.var.rate:** –3 to +1.  
- **cons.price.idx:** 92–94.  
- **cons.conf.idx:** –50 to –25.  
- **euribor3m:** 0.6–5.0.  
- **nr.employed:** 4960–5228.  

**Summary:** Duration, campaign, pdays, previous are skewed. Economic indicators are stable.  

---

## Are There Missing Values?  

No raw `NA`s, but several variables use **special placeholders**:  

- **default = "unknown"** (~20%) → many clients do not disclose credit default history.  
- **education = "unknown"** (~5%) → a smaller but noticeable fraction of clients.  
- **job = "unknown"** (~1%) → minimal impact.  
- **pdays = 999** (~96% of clients) → not truly missing, indicates “never contacted before.”  

**Summary:**  
The dataset contains **structural missing values** rather than random NA’s. These should be **treated as valid categories or transformed into features** (e.g., `pdays = 999` → “not previously contacted”), instead of dropping rows, to avoid losing important information.  

---

# PART II: Pre-Processing {.tabset}  

### A. Data Cleaning  
- Replace `"unknown"` with explicit category *missing*.  
- Treat `pdays=999` as *not previously contacted*.  
- Keep outliers but apply transformations (e.g., log for regression).  
- Remove duplicates if present.  

### B. Dimensionality Reduction  
- Drop/reduce highly correlated economic indicators (emp.var.rate, euribor3m, nr.employed).  
- Logistic regression sensitive to multicollinearity; decision trees less so.  

### C. Feature Engineering  
- **pdays:** create `was_contacted_before` (binary) + `pdays_num` (numeric if not 999).  
- **Loans:** create `any_loan`.  
- **Age groups:** youth <30, middle 30–50, senior >50.  
- **Interactions:** duration × contact type.  

### D. Sampling  
- Large dataset (~41k), so no down-sampling needed.  
- Handle imbalance (~11% “yes”) with SMOTE, undersampling, or class weights.  

### E. Transformation  
- Normalize numeric variables for regression.  
- One-hot encode categoricals (keep `"unknown"`).  
- Log transform skewed features (`duration`, `campaign`, `previous`).  

### F. Imbalanced Data  
- Use SMOTE or class weights.  
- Evaluate with Precision, Recall, F1 (not just accuracy).  

**Final Preprocessing Summary**  
1. Handled structural missing values.  
2. Retained but transformed meaningful outliers.  
3. Reduced redundancy in economic indicators.  
4. Engineered features (e.g., any_loan, was_contacted_before).  
5. Prepared dataset for balanced, interpretable modeling.

# --- 4. Split target and predictors ---

# --- 5. One-hot encode + impute + scale (recipe-style with caret) ---
dmy <- dummyVars(" ~ .", data = predictors)
X <- data.frame(predict(dmy, newdata = predictors))

# Impute + scale
pre <- preProcess(X, method = c("medianImpute","center","scale"))
X_imp <- predict(pre, X)

# ✅ Check consistency
stopifnot(nrow(X_imp) == length(y))
cat("Rows in X_imp:", nrow(X_imp), " | Rows in y:", length(y), "\n")

# --- 6. Handle Imbalance ---
## Option A: SMOTE
set.seed(123)
sm <- SMOTE(X_imp, y, K = 5)
df_smote <- sm$data
df_smote$y <- factor(df_smote$class, levels = c("no","yes"))
df_smote$class <- NULL
table(df_smote$y)

## Option B: Upsampling
set.seed(123)
up <- upSample(x = X_imp, y = y, yname = "y")
table(up$y)

```
I used caret::dummyVars() → safer, keeps all rows.

Applied preProcess() after dummy encoding → imputes pdays_num and others before scaling.

Now nrow(X_imp) and length(y) will always match (41,176 rows).

Original: High accuracy, but recall for "yes" will be poor (model predicts "no" most of the time).

SMOTE: Recall for "yes" improves since synthetic examples balance the dataset.

Upsampling: Recall also improves, but can overfit since it duplicates minority examples.


# PART III: Algorithm Selection {.tabset}  

### Business Context  
- **Goal:** predict subscription (y = yes/no).  
- **Size:** ~41k records, mixed variables.  
- **Challenge:** Class imbalance (~11% yes).  
- **Need:** Balance interpretability and predictive power.  

### Candidate Algorithms  

**1. Logistic Regression**  
- Pros: interpretable coefficients, probability outputs, efficient.  
- Cons: assumes linear log-odds, requires preprocessing, may miss nonlinearities.  

**2. Decision Tree**  
- Pros: handles numeric/categorical, captures interactions, intuitive rules.  
- Cons: prone to overfitting, less stable, lower accuracy than ensembles.  

**3. Naïve Bayes (secondary)**  
- Pros: fast, works with categorical data, probabilistic.  
- Cons: assumes independence, less accurate on structured business data.  

---

### Recommended Algorithm  
- **Primary:** Logistic Regression → interpretability + regulatory alignment.  
- **Secondary:** Decision Tree → captures nonlinear patterns, generates actionable rules.  

---

### Responses to Questions  

1. **Are there labels?**  
   Yes → y (yes/no). It’s supervised classification.  

2. **How does algorithm choice relate to data?**  
   Large, imbalanced dataset with mixed variables → logistic regression + decision tree fit well.  

3. **What if dataset < 1,000 records?**  
   Prefer simpler models (logistic regression, LDA, Naïve Bayes). Decision trees may be unstable.  

---

### Justification  
1. **Data characteristics:** supervised, binary classification with imbalance → logistic regression fits well.  
2. **Problem type:** supervised learning, classification.  
3. **Business needs:** interpretability and actionable insights → logistic regression + decision tree.  

---

### Final Answer  
I recommend **Logistic Regression** as the primary model for interpretability and alignment with business context, with **Decision Trees** as a complementary method to capture nonlinear patterns.
